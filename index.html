    <h3>Java Project 2022</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project was made during my second term of Java programming module.
      I was tasked with making a 2D platform game that demonstrates my understanding of inheritence,
      methods, fields, constuctors and the physics engine provided to me. I created a platform game 
      in which you must avoid the enemies and acquire energy orbs as you try to escape the dungeon.
      There are mutliple levels throughout and you must have the target number of energy orbs to
      go to the next level.
